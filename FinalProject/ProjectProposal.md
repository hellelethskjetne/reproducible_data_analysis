Title: Martian Secondary Crater Size-Range Analysis
---------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through this project I will explore the size-range relationship of Martian secondary craters. Secondary craters form during a primary impact when an asteroid strikes the surface of a planetary surface, such as Mars (but are found across surfaces of most solid bodies in our solar system). During the primary impact fragments of the asteroid and the impacted surface are ejected on a radial ballistic trajectory away from the impact site at hypervelocity, and when these fragments strike the surface of a planetary body, they produce what is known as "secondary craters". Secondary craters are clearly differentiable from smaller primary impact craters by their morphology; e.g., v-shaped semi-circles with a dusty "tail", forms in radial crater chains and clusters, and does not form "perfect" circles similarly to smaller primary impacts.

The goal of this project is to produce a reproducible code in RStudio that can analyze raw data (.csv or Microsoft Excel) obtained in ESRI's ArcMap environment to analyze size-range properties and trends in secondary craters on Mars and other bodies. These datasets will consist of information about central latitude and longitude location, diameter, confidence rating on size and whether it is a secondary crater. The code will use this information to calculate trends in secondary crater size with distance (range) away from the primary crater and determine whether there is a trend in the upper percentile sizes across this range in order to study secondary cratering. The deliverable from this project will be designed to analyze data that is currently being collected for several secondary crate ranges across the surface of Mars and will consist of a code that organizes these data, analyzes trends in these data, and generates meaningful plots to visualize these data. The data to be utilized in this project is part of my doctoral dissertation work in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (UTK).
